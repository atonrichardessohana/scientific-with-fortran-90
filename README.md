## Exercise: second degree  Equation Solver
This program solves a second-degree (quadratic) equation of the form:
ax² + bx + c = 0
- Reads the coefficients a, b, and c from user input
- Checks that a ≠ 0 to ensure a valid quadratic equation
- Computes the discriminant Δ = b² − 4ac
- Handles:
  - two distinct real solutions (Δ > 0)
  - one real double solution (Δ = 0)
  - two complex conjugate solutions (Δ < 0)
- Displays results clearly and explicitly
#key  Concepts
- Conditional statements
- Numerical computation
- Discriminant-based decision logic
This exercise illustrates fundamental concepts in numerical methods
and algorithmic problem-solving, which form the basis of more advanced
## THE PROGRAM SEQUENCE.f90
The program computes the first *n* terms of the sequence defined by:
u₀ = 1  
uₙ₊₁ = 2uₙ + 3
The user provides an integer value *n*, and the program iteratively
computes and displays the corresponding sequence values.
